Welcome to the read me,

Installations for collaboration!

If you dont already have git installed, then install it here
download link - https://git-scm.com/downloads

Step 1: Install XAMPP
download link - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

This is a tool that contains a web server called Apache, basically it gives the info to your web browser, and a database tool called MySQL that is used to create and manage databases which is where we can store basically any info or data we need.

Step 2: Install VSCODE
download link - https://code.visualstudio.com/

this is just the IDE or "code editor", it has built in functionality with github so thats why we use it.

Step 3: Use git in VSCODE to PULL the project files
Here is a helpful video for that. https://youtu.be/i_23KUAEtUM?si=rNBGl1KsLbrDNN3L

Step 4: create new branch and get to work.
