Welcome to the read me,

This is a side project of mine I started a few weeks ago from now(11/17/24), I remember wanting to play a modded minecraft server with friends but didnt have enough resources on my own computer to host the server, so i had to use one of those game server services. So im trying to recreate one of those from scratch as a way to teach myself the ins and outs of webdevelopement.

What is kosi_host supposed to be?
Kosi_Host is intended to be a website that users can visit to "rent" already configured game servers hosted by us.

Where will you be hosting these servers?
Right now, the plan is to use AWS EC2 instances to host the game servers and website.




Installations for collaboration!

If you dont already have git installed, then install it here
download link - https://git-scm.com/downloads

Step 1: Install XAMPP
download link - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

This is a tool that contains a web server called Apache, basically it gives the info to your web browser, and a database tool called MySQL that is used to create and manage databases which is where we can store basically any info or data we need.

Step 2: Install VSCODE
download link - https://code.visualstudio.com/

this is just the IDE or "code editor", it has built in functionality with github so thats why we use it.

Step 3: Use git in VSCODE to PULL the project files
Here is a helpful video for that. https://youtu.be/i_23KUAEtUM?si=rNBGl1KsLbrDNN3L

Step 4: create new branch and get to work.
